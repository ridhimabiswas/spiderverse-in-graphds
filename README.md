Assignment description: https://ds.cs.rutgers.edu/assignment-spider-verse/ 

Welcome to the Spider-Verse!

In the Spider-Verse there are many different Dimensions and just as many Spider-People. As you wouldâ€™ve guessed, with great power comes great responsibility and these Spiders are tasked with protecting their Dimension from any threat that may hurt anyone.

To help visualize the Spider-Verse, we can make a graph of all the different Dimensions, with some holding any number of Spiders and any number of anomalies. Anomalies are people (mainly villains) who have been sent to a different Dimension as the result of the mob boss named Kingpin running dangerous Particle Collider experiments in Dimension 1610.

Dimension 1610 is home to Miles Morales, one of the many Spider-men, and is also the source of the anomalies. We need to set them straight along with finding out some useful information about graphs along the way. In each method you will learn some backstory for the method, which will be implemented by you
